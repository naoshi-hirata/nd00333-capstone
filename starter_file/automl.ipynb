Hence, if the user doesn't provide an explicit validation dataset, a part of the training dataset is used to achieve this. For smaller datasets (fewer than 20,000 samples), cross-validation is leveraged, else a single hold-out set is split from the training data to serve as the validation dataset. Hence, for your input data we leverage cross-validation with 10 folds, if the number of training samples are fewer than 1000, and 3 folds in all other cases.\n              Learn more about cross
